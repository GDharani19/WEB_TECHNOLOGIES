            In an interview with ET, the Infosys founder hailed the Modi government for drafting the National Education Policy (NEP), and said tech firms should use the current downturn to
             innovate and expand their market share to emerge winners when the market is up.
            Infosys founder NR Narayana Murthy suggested incentives for private and public funds to set aside a portion of their capital for boosting domestic
             investment in Indian startups in an interview with ET. The Infosys founder also hailed the Narendra Modi government for drafting the National Education Policy (NEP).
              On the sidelines of the Infosys Prize announcement, Murthy said tech firms should use the current downturn to innovate and expand their market share to emerge winners when the market.
              It has been a very positive experiment. The number of winners is now sizable at around 90 winners now. A few of them have gone on to win bigger prizes. However, our desire is that we should see a few Fields Medal winners and Nobel laureates who have worked in India. Looking around, I believe that will happen as we move forward.

                    <h2>Elon Musk, in a tweet, said that OpenAI should go public with the reason behind firing Sam Altman.</h2> The billionaire says that there is a "bombshell variable" the public knows nothing about.
                    It has been quite a dramatic turn of events at OpenAI in the last couple of days. Sam Altman, co-founder of OpenAI, was fired by the board of directors and since then it has been one twist or another in what is turning to be quite a saga. Here is everything you need to know about the drama unfolding at OpenAI <br>

                    <h3>It was a fine weekend for the tech world until news of Sam Altman being ousted from OpenAI started doing rounds.</h3> Soon, the internet was full of reports of the former CEO's exit from the AI company, and the OpenAI board said in a statement that it no longer has faith in Altman's 
                    capabilities to lead the company. This came as a complete surprise and nothing of the sorts was anticipated. A report in Bloomberg said that the news of Sam's exit was a complete surprise for him as well.
                    Elon Musk’s social media company X filed a lawsuit against liberal advocacy group Media Matters for America on Monday, saying it manufactured a report to show advertisers’ posts alongside neo-Nazi and white nationalist posts in order to “drive advertisers from the platform and destroy X Corp.”

Media Matters, a Washington, D.C.-based non-profit, called the lawsuit “frivolous.” Advertisers have been fleeing the site formerly known as Twitter over concerns about their ads showing up next to pro-Nazi content —
 
 IBM, NBCUniversal and its parent company Comcast said last week that they stopped advertising on X after the Media Matters report said their ads were appearing alongside material praising Nazis. It was a fresh setback as the platform tries to win back big brands and their ad dollars, X’s main source of revenue.

                “We have already worked very hard and created the IT Rules in April 2023. We will continue to create a framework, including but not limited to, if necessary, a new legislation to ensure that deepfakes or misinformation at large do not pose a threat...

            The Supreme Court on Tuesday rapped the Punjab government for not taking strict actions against stubble burning, one of the biggest causes of air pollution in Delhi-NCR, and observed that farmers are presented as villains while not getting adequate chances to be heard in court.

The apex court made the observations while hearing a series of petitions on the toxic air across Delhi that has created a chokehold-like situation for the residents of the national capital.

The bench also stated the AAP-led Punjab government’s report suggested that over 8,400 meetings were held with farmers and farmer leaders to convince them to not burn paddy straws by state house officers but still the number of farm fires could not be abated, the publication reported.

            India Prime Minister Narendra Modi visited the Indian cricket team’s dressing room after the heartbreaking defeat to Australia in the final of 2023 ODI World Cup. PM Modi was present at the stadium which has been named after him in Ahmedabad to support the Indian team in the mega clash but Australia outclassed the hosts in all three departments to register a 6-wicket win in the all-important clash.

The Indian players were dejected after the heartbreaking defeat as Mohammed Siraj even shed a tear on the pitch itself.

PM Modi and Home Minister Amit Shah visited the Indian players in the dressing room
 and consoled them. A photo of PM Narendra Modi holding Virat Kohli and Rohit Sharma’s hands went viral on social media.
